h1. Smoke Signals

h2. Forked

The original smoke signals was unnecessarily noisy when everything was going smoothly. Smoke signals should only be sent when a build is in trouble. This forked version sends failure messages to campfire when the build breaks and sends them continually until the build is fixed.

h2. Description

A plugin for CruiseControl.rb offering the following features:

* Sends notifications to a Campfire room when the build breaks. The message includes the name of the last committer along with a URL to the build.
* Detects and sends notifications of Subversion failures.
* Supports different rooms per project. 

h2. Install

Download smoke_signals via git (git clone git://github.com/relevance/smoke_signals.git) or as a tarball (http://github.com/relevance/smoke_signals/tarball/master). Then, on your cruisecontrol.rb server:

 # sudo gem install tinder
 # cp lib/smoke_signals.rb <CRUISE_ROOT>/builder_plugins/installed
 # cp smoke_signals.yml_sample <CRUISE_ROOT>/config/smoke_signals.yml
 # edit <CRUISE_ROOT>/config/smoke_signals.yml with your campfire specifics
 # for project-specific rooms, in your build's specific cruise_config.rb add the following: 
 #     project.smoke_signals.room_name = "Room name" # replace Room name
 # restart CruiseControl.rb
